.SH NAME
conserver.cf \- console configuration file for
.BR conserver (8)
.SH DESCRIPTION
The format of the conserver.cf file is made up of named blocks of
keyword/value pairs, comments, and optional whitespace for formatting
flexibility.
The block types as well as the keywords are pre-defined and
explained in the
.B \s-1BLOCKS\s0
section.
A comment is an unquoted pound-sign
to a newline.
See the
.B \s-1PARSER\s0
section for full details on whitespace and quoting.
.PP
Let me first show you a sample block with a couple of keyword/value
pairs to make the description a bit simpler to understand.
.IP
.ft CR
.nf
console simple { master localhost; type exec; rw *; }
.fi
.ft
.PP
This is actually a fully functional conserver.cf file (if certain
conditions are met...and if you can list those conditions, you can
probably can skip to the
.B \s-1BLOCKS\s0
section).
.PP
Our example is made of up of a console-block named ``simple'' with three
keyword/value pairs.
What this does is define a console named ``simple'',
makes the master of that console the host ``localhost'', makes the type
an exec-style console, and gives every user read/write permission.
This is the generic format of the file:
.IP
.ft CR
.nf
block-type block-name { keyword value; ... }
.fi
.ft
.PP
To show the addition of comments and whitespace, here is the example
reformatted (but functionally equivalent):
.IP
.ft CR
.nf
# define a console named "simple"
console simple {
    # setting all required values...
    master localhost;
    type exec;  # exec-style console
    rw *;       # allow any username
}
.fi
.ft
.SH PARSER
.PP
The parser has six characters that it considers special.
These are: ``{'', ``}'', ``;'', ``#'', ``\e'', and ``"''.
The first three (hereby called tokens) define the format of the
configuration blocks and are used as word
separators, the next is the comment character, and the last two are
quoting characters.
.PP
Word separation occurs when the parser encounters an unquoted token
and, in certain cases, whitespace.
Whitespace is only used as a word separator when the parser is
looking for a block-type or keyword.
When it's looking for a block-name or value, whitespace is like any
other character, which allows you to embed whitespace in a block-name
or value without having to quote it.
Here is an example:
.IP
.ft CR
.nf
default my defs { rw *; include other defs  ; }
.fi
.ft
.PP
The block-type is ``default'', the block-name is ``my defs'', and the value
for the keyword ``include'' is ``other defs''.
Whitespace around tokens are ignored so you get ``other defs''
instead of ``other defs  '' as the value.
.PP
The only way to use one of the special characters as part of a block-name
or value is to quote it.
.PP
Quoting is a simple matter of prefixing a character with a backslash or
surrounding a group of characters with double-quotes.
If a character is prefixed by a backslash, the next character is a
literal (so ``\e\e'' produces a ``\e'', ``\e"'' produces ``"'', ``\e{''
produces a ``{'', etc.).
For double-quoted strings, all characters are literal except for ``\e"'',
which embeds a double-quote.
.PP
Adding a variety of quotes to our example without changing the meaning
of things, we have:
.IP
.ft CR
.nf
"defa"ult my\e defs { rw *; in\eclude "other defs"  ; }
.fi
.ft
.PP
There is one special line the parser recognizes: a ``#include'' statement.
It is of the form:
.IP
.B #include
.I filename
.PP
Any whitespace around
.I filename
is ignored, but whitespace embedded inside is preserved.
Everything in
.I filename
is taken literally, so none of the normal parser quoting applies.
The
.B #include
must begin in ``column 0'' - no whitespace is allowed between it and
the start of the physical line.
There is an include file depth limit of 10 to prevent infinite recursion.
.SH BLOCKS
.TP
\f3access\fP \f2hostname\fP|\f2ipaddr\fP
.br
Define an access block for the host named
.I hostname
or using the address
.IR ipaddr .
If the value of ``*'' is used, the access block will be applied to
all conserver hosts.
Access lists are used in a first match
fashion (top down), so order is important.
.RS
.TP
\f3admin\fP [\f3!\fP]\f2username\fP[\f3,\fP...]|\f3""\fP
.br
Define a list of users making up the admin list for the console server.
If
.I username
matches a previously defined group name, all members of the previous
group are applied to the admin list (with access reversed if prefixed
with a `!').
If
.I username
doesn't match a previously defined group and
.I username
begins with `@', the name (minus the `@') is checked against the
host's group database.
All users found in the group will be granted (or denied, if prefixed
with `!') access.
If
.I username
doesn't match a previous group and doesn't begin with `@', the users
will be granted (or denied, if prefixed with `!') access.
If the null string (``\f3""\fP'') is used, any
users previously defined for the console servers's admin list are removed.
.TP
\f3allowed\fP \f2hostname\fP[\f3,\fP...]
.br
The list of hostnames are added to the ``allowed'' list, which grants
connections from the hosts but requires username authentication.
.TP
\f3include\fP \f2accessgroup\fP
.br
The access lists defined using the name
.I accessgroup
are applied to the current access block.
The included access block must be previously defined.
.TP
\f3limited\fP [\f3!\fP]\f2username\fP[\f3,\fP...]|\f3""\fP
.br
Define a list of users with limited functionality on the console server.
These users will not be allowed to suspend their connection,
shift to another console, or attach to a local command.
If
.I username
matches a previously defined group name, all members of the previous
group are applied to the admin list (with access reversed if prefixed
with a `!').
If
.I username
doesn't match a previously defined group and
.I username
begins with `@', the name (minus the `@') is checked against the
host's group database.
All users found in the group will be granted (or denied, if prefixed
with `!') access.
If
.I username
doesn't match a previous group and doesn't begin with `@', the users
will be granted (or denied, if prefixed with `!') access.
If the null string (``\f3""\fP'') is used, any
users previously defined for the console server's limited list are removed.
.TP
\f3rejected\fP \f2hostname\fP[\f3,\fP...]
.br
The list of hostnames are added to the ``rejected'' list, which rejects
connections from the hosts.
.TP
\f3trusted\fP \f2hostname\fP[\f3,\fP...]
.br
The list of hostnames are added to the ``trusted'' list, which grants
connections from the hosts without username authentication.
.RE
.TP
\f3break\fP \f2n\fP
.br
Define a break sequence where (1 <=
.I n

all conserver hosts.
.RS
.TP
\f3autocomplete\fP \f3yes\fP|\f3true\fP|\f3on\fP|\f3no\fP|\f3false\fP|\f3off\fP
.br
Turn the console name autocompletion feature on or off.
If autocompletion is on, a client can use any unique leading portion of a
console name when connecting to a console.
Autocompletion is on by default.
.TP
\f3defaultaccess\fP \f3rejected\fP|\f3trusted\fP|\f3allowed\fP
.br
Set the default access permission for all hosts not matched by
an access list (see the

.TP
\f3daemonmode\fP \f3yes\fP|\f3true\fP|\f3on\fP|\f3no\fP|\f3false\fP|\f3off\fP
.br
Set whether or not to become a daemon when run (see the
.B \-d
command-line flag).
.TP
\f3initdelay\fP \f2number\fP
.br
Set the number of seconds between console initializations.
All consoles with the same
.B host
value will be throttled as a group (those without a
.B host
value are their own group).
In other words, each console within a group will only be initialized after
.I number
seconds passes from the previous initialization of a console in that group.
Different throttle groups are initialized simultaneously.
One warning: since consoles are split up and managed by seperate conserver
processes, it's possible for more than one conserver process to
have a throttle group based on a particular
.B host
value.
If this happens, each conserver process will throttle their groups 
independently of the other conserver processes, which results in a
more rapid initialization (per
.B host
value) than one might otherwise expect.
If
.I number
is zero, all consoles are initialized without delay.
.TP
\f3logfile\fP \f2filename\fP

respectively.
.I user
may be a username or numeric uid and
.I group
may be a group name or numeric gid.
Either one is optional.
If the server is not running with root privileges, these values
are not used.
If the null string (``\f3""\fP'') is specified, the default of running
with the same privileges as the server is restored.

pseudo-random delay of up to one minute (to help prevent all processes
checking all consoles simultaneously).
2.5% (minimum 100 bytes, maximum 4000 bytes) of the old
logfile is read from the end of the file.
All data past the first newline is moved (not copied) to the new logfile
so that a replay of the console works and starts on a line boundary.
.TP
\f3master\fP \f2hostname\fP|\f2ipaddr\fP
.br
Define which conserver host manages the console.
The host may be specified by
.I hostname
or using the address
.IR ipaddr .
.TP
\f3motd\fP \f2message\fP|\f3""\fP
.br
Set the "message of the day" for the console to
.IR message ,
which gets displayed when a client attaches to the console.
If the null string (``\f3""\fP'') is used, the MOTD is unset and
no message will occur.
.TP
\f3options\fP [\f3!\fP]option[\f3,\fP...]|\f3""\fP
.br
You can negate the option by prefixing it with a
.RB `` ! ''
character.
So, to turn off the
.B hupcl
flag, you would use
.BR !hupcl .
The following are valid
.IR option s:
.RS
.sp
.PD 0
.TP 12
.B ixon
Enable
.SM XON/XOFF
flow control on output.
Only consoles of type ``device'' or ``exec'' will use this value.
Default is
.BR ixon .
.TP
.B ixany
Enable any character to restart output.
Only consoles of type ``device'' or ``exec'' will use this value.
Default is
.BR !ixany .
.TP
.B ixoff
Enable
.SM XON/XOFF
flow control on input.
Only consoles of type ``device'' or ``exec'' will use this value.
Default is
.B ixoff
for consoles of type ``device'' and
.B !ixoff
for consoles of type ``exec''.
.TP
.B crtscts
Enable
.SM RTS/CTS
(hardware) flow control.
Only consoles of type ``device'' will use this value.
Default is
.BR !crtscts .
.TP
.B cstopb
Set two stop bits, rather than one.
Only consoles of type ``device'' will use this value.
Default is
.BR !cstopb .
.TP
.B hupcl
Lower modem control lines after last process closes the device (hang up).
Only consoles of type ``device'' will use this value.
Default is
.BR !hupcl .
.TP
.B ondemand
Initialize the console when a client requests a connection to the console.
When no clients are connected, bring the console down.
The conserver option
.B \-i
will set this flag for all consoles.
Default is
.BR !ondemand .
.TP
.B striphigh
Strip the high bit off all data coming from this console and all clients
connected to this console before processing occurs.
The conserver option
.B \-7
will set this flag for all consoles.
Default is
.BR !striphigh .
.TP
.B reinitoncc
Automatically reinitialize (``bring up'') a downed console when a client
connects.
Without this option, a client will be attached to the downed console
and will need to manually reinitialize the console with an escape sequence.
The conserver option
.B \-o
will set this flag for all consoles.
Default is
.BR !reinitoncc .
.TP
.B autoreinit
Allow this console to be automatically reinitialized if it unexpectedly
goes down.
If the console doesn't come back up, it is retried every minute.
A console of type ``exec'' that exits with a zero exit status is
automatically reinitialized regardless of this setting.
The conserver option
.B \-F
will
.B unset
this flag for all consoles.
Default is
.BR autoreinit .
.TP
.B unloved
Enable the sending of this console's output (prefixed with its
name) to the daemon's stdout (or the logfile if in daemon mode) when no
clients are connected to the console.
The conserver option
.B \-u
will set this flag for all consoles.
Default is
.BR !unloved .
.TP
.B login
Allow users to log into this console.
If logins are not allowed, conserver will send a generic message to the
client saying so and terminate the connection.
You can override the generic message by setting the
.B motd
message.
Default is
.BR login .
.PD
.RE
.TP
\f3parity\fP \f3even\fP|\f3mark\fP|\f3none\fP|\f3odd\fP|\f3space\fP
.br
Set the parity option for the console.
Only consoles of type ``device'' will use this value.
.TP
\f3password\fP \f2password\fP|\f3""\fP
.br
Use
.I password
during IPMI authentication.
If the null string (``\f3""\fP'') is used (the default), no password will be used.
.TP
\f3port\fP \f2number\fP|\f2name\fP
.br
Set the port used to access the console.
The port may be specified as a
.I number
or a
.IR name .
A
.I name
will cause a
.BR getservbyname (3)
call to look up the port number.
The
.BR port ,
.BR portbase ,
and
.B portinc
values are all used to calculate the final port number to connect to.
The formula used is
.IR finalport " = "
.BR portbase " + "
.BR portinc " * " port .
By using proper values in the formula, you can reference ports on a
terminal server by their physical numbering of
.RI 0.. n
or
.RI 1.. n
(depending on if you like zero-based or one-based numbering).
Warning: you can generate a -1 value with this formula,
which will become a very high numbered positive
value (since things are stored unsigned).
You must also set the
.B host
option as well.
Normally, only consoles of type ``host'' will use this value, however
if the
.BR devicesubst ,
.BR execsubst ,
or
.B initsubst
keywords are used in any console type, this value is used.
.TP
\f3portbase\fP \f2number\fP
.br
Set the base value for the port calculation formula.
.I number
must be 0 or greater.
The default is zero.
See
.B port
for the details of the formula.
.TP
\f3portinc\fP \f2number\fP
.br
Set the increment value for the port calculation formula.
.I number
must be 0 or greater.
The default is one.
See
.B port
for the details of the formula.
.TP
\f3protocol\fP \f3telnet\fP|\f3raw\fP
.br
Set the protocol used to send and receive data from the console.
If
.B raw
is used, all data is sent ``as is'', unprotected by any protocol specification.
If
.B telnet
is used (which is the default), data is encapsulated in the telnet protocol.
The
.B striphigh
console option still applies when data is read by the server, and if enabled,
can impact the encapsulation process.
.TP
\f3replstring\fP \f2string\fP
.br
A generic replacement string that can be used by the
.BR devicesubst ,
.BR execsubst ,
and
.B initsubst
keywords.
.TP
\f3ro\fP [\f3!\fP]\f2username\fP[\f3,\fP...]|\f3""\fP
.br
Define a list of users making up the read-only access list
for the console.
If
.I username
matches a previously defined group name, all members of the previous
group are applied to the read-only access list (with access reversed
if prefixed with a `!').
If
.I username
doesn't match a previously defined group and
.I username
begins with `@', the name (minus the `@') is checked against the
host's group database.
All users found in the group will be granted (or denied, if prefixed
with `!') read-only access.
If
.I username
doesn't match a previous group and doesn't begin with `@', the users
will be granted (or denied, if prefixed with `!') read-only access.
If the null string (``\f3""\fP'') is used, any
users previously defined for the console's read-only list are removed.
.TP
\f3rw\fP [\f3!\fP]\f2username\fP[\f3,\fP...]|\f3""\fP
.br
Define a list of users making up the read-write access list
for the console.
If
.I username
matches a previously defined group name, all members of the previous
group are applied to the read-write access list (with access reversed
if prefixed with a `!').
If
.I username
doesn't match a previously defined group and
.I username
begins with `@', the name (minus the `@') is checked against the
host's group database.
All users found in the group will be granted (or denied, if prefixed
with `!') read-write access.
If
.I username
doesn't match a previous group and doesn't begin with `@', the users
will be granted (or denied, if prefixed with `!') read-write access.
If the null string (``\f3""\fP'') is used, any
users previously defined for the console's read-write list are removed.
.TP
\f3tasklist\fP \f2c\fP[\f3,\fP...]|\f3""\fP
Associate a list of tasks referenced by
.I c
with the console.
If ``*'' is used (the default), all defined tasks will be available.
If the null string (``\f3""\fP'') is used, no tasks will be available.
.TP
\f3timestamp\fP [\f2number\fP[\f3m\fP|\f3h\fP|\f3d\fP|\f3l\fP]][\f3a\fP][\f3b\fP]|\f3""\fP
.br
Specifies the time between timestamps applied to the console
log file and whether to log read/write connection actions.
The timestamps look like ``[-- MARK -- Mon Jan 25 14:46:56 1999]''.
The
.RB ` m ',
.RB ` h ',
and
.RB ` d '
tags specify ``minutes'' (the default), ``hours'', and ``days''.
The
.RB ` l '
tag specifies ``lines'' and will cause timestamps of the
form ``[Mon Jan 25 14:46:56 PST 1999]'' to
be placed every
.I number
lines (a newline character signifies a new line).
So, ``5h'' specifies every five hours and ``2l'' specifies every
two lines.
An
.RB ` a '
can be specified to add logs of ``attached'', ``detached'',
and ``bumped'' actions, including the user's name and the host from which the
client connection was made.
A
.RB ` b '
can be specified to add logging of break sequences sent to the console.
.TP
\f3type\fP \f3device\fP|\f3ipmi\fP|\f3exec\fP|\f3host\fP|\f3noop\fP|\f3uds\fP
.br
Set the type of console.
A type of
.RB `` device ''
should be used for local serial ports (also set the
.B device
value).
A type of
.RB `` ipmi ''
should be used for IPMI serial over LAN consoles (also set the
.B host
value and possibly the
.BR username ,
.BR password ,
and
.BR ipmi *
values).
A type of
.RB `` exec ''
should be used for command invocations (perhaps also set the
.B exec
value).
A type of
.RB `` host ''
should be used for terminal servers and other TCP socket-based
interaction (also set the
.B host
and
.B port
values).
A type of
.RB `` noop ''
should be used as a placeholder - it does nothing, ignores any
.B logfile
value and forces the
.B !nologin
option (so you might want to set the
.B motd
value).
A type of
.RB `` uds ''
should be used for Unix domain sockets (also set the
.B uds
option).
.TP
\f3uds\fP \f2filename\fP
.br
Assign the Unix domain socket
.I filename
as the path to the console.
Only consoles of type ``uds'' will use this value.
.TP
\f3udssubst\fP \f2c\fP\f3=\fP\f2t\fP[\f2n\fP]\f2f\fP[\f3,\fP...]|\f3""\fP
.br
Perform character substitutions on the
.B uds
value.
See the
.B devicesubst
option for an explanation of the format string.
If the null string (``\f3""\fP'') is used, no replacements will be done.
.TP
\f3username\fP \f2username\fP|\f3""\fP
.br
Use
.I username
during IPMI authentication.
If the null string (``\f3""\fP'') is used (the default), the ``null'' user will be used.
.RE
.TP
\f3group\fP \f2name\fP
.br
Define a user group identified as
.IR name .
.RS
.TP
\f3users\fP [\f3!\fP]\f2username\fP[\f3,\fP...]|\f3""\fP
.br
Define a list of users making up the group
.IR name .
If
.I username
matches a previously defined group name, all members of the previous
group are applied to the current group (with access reversed
if prefixed with a `!').
If
.I username
doesn't match a previously defined group and
.I username
begins with `@', the name (minus the `@') is checked against the
host's group database.
All users found in the group will be recorded with (or without, if prefixed
with `!') access.
If
.I username
doesn't match a previous group and doesn't begin with `@', the users
will be recorded with (or without, if prefixed with `!') access.
If the null string (``\f3""\fP'') is used, any
users previously defined for this group are removed.
.RE
.TP
\f3task\fP \f2c\fP
.br
Define a task where
.I c
is a lowercase alphanumeric (0-9a-z).
Tasks are invoked via the
.RI ``^Ec! c ''
client escape sequence.
.RS
.TP
\f3cmd\fP \f2command\fP|\f3""\fP
.br
Invoke
.I command
on the server when instructed by the client.
All file descriptors are closed, except for stderr (which is inherited from
the server).
The
.I command
is passed as an argument to ``/bin/sh -ce'' and is a ``fire and forget''
methodology (you need to check logs for any issues).
If the null string (``\f3""\fP'') is used, the entire task definition is ignored.
.TP
\f3confirm\fP \f3yes\fP|\f3true\fP|\f3on\fP|\f3no\fP|\f3false\fP|\f3off\fP
.br
Set whether or not to ask the client for confirmation before invoking the task.
The default is ``no''.
.TP
\f3description\fP \f2string\fP
.br
Set a description for the task.  When a client lists tasks,
.I string
will be printed instead of the command defined above.
If the null string (``\f3""\fP'') is used, the command defined above will
be printed.
.TP
\f3runas\fP [\f2user\fP][:\f2group\fP]|\f3""\fP
.br
By default, the command invoked by
.B cmd
is run with the same privileges as the server.
If the server is running with root privileges, this option resets the user
and/or group of the invoked process to
.I user
and
.I group
respectively.
.I user
may be a username or numeric uid and
.I group
may be a group name or numeric gid.
Either one is optional.
If the server is not running with root privileges, these values
are not used.
If the null string (``\f3""\fP'') is specified, the default of running
with the same privileges as the server is restored.
.TP
\f3subst\fP \f2c\fP\f3=\fP\f2t\fP[\f2n\fP]\f2f\fP[\f3,\fP...]|\f3""\fP
.br
Perform character substitutions on the
.B cmd
