.SH DESCRIPTION
.B Conserver
is the daemon that manages
remote access to system consoles by multiple users via the
.BR console (1)
client program and (optionally) log the console output.
It can connect to consoles via local serial ports, Unix domain sockets, TCP
sockets (for terminal servers and the like), or any external program.
.PP
When started,
.B conserver
reads the
.BR conserver.cf (5)
file for details of each console.
The console type, logging options, serial or network parameters, and user access
levels are just a few of the things that can be specified.
Command-line options are then applied, possibly overriding
.BR conserver.cf (5)
settings.
.B Conserver
categorizes consoles into two types: those it should actively manage, and
those it should just know about, so it can refer clients to other
.B conserver
instances.
If the
.B master
value of a console matches the hostname or ip address of the local machine,
.B conserver
will actively manage the console.
Otherwise, it's considered a ``remote'' console and managed by a different
server.
.B Conserver
forks a child for each group of consoles it must manage
and assigns each process a port number to listen on.
The maximum number of consoles managed by each child process is set using the
.B \-m
option.
The
.BR console (1)
client program communicates with the master console server process to find
the port (and host, in a multi-server configuration)
on which the appropriate child is listening.
.B Conserver
restricts connections from clients based on the host access section of its
.BR conserver.cf (5)
file, restricts users based on the console access lists of the
.BR conserver.cf (5)
file, and authenticates
users against its
.BR conserver.passwd (5)
file.
.B Conserver
can also restrict clients using the tcp-wrappers package (enabled
using
.BR --with-libwrap ).
This authentication is done before consulting
the
.BR conserver.cf (5)
access list.
.PP
When Unix domain sockets are used between the client and
server (enabled using
.BR --with-uds ),
authentication checks are done on the hardcoded address ``127.0.0.1''.
Automatic client redirection is also disabled (as if the
.B \-R
option was used) since the client cannot communicate with remote servers.
The directory used to hold the sockets is checked to make sure it's empty
when the server starts.
The server will
.B not
remove any files in the directory itself, just in case the directory is
accidentally specified as ``/etc'' or some other critical location.
The server will do its best to remove all the sockets when it shuts down,
but it could stop ungracefully (crash, ``kill -9'', etc)
and leave files behind.
It would then be up to the admin (or a creative startup script) to clean
up the directory before the server will start again.
.PP
.B Conserver
completely controls any connection to a console.
All escape sequences given by the user to
.B console
are passed to the server without interpretation.
The server recognizes and processes all escape sequences.
.PP
The
.B conserver
parent process will automatically respawn any child process that dies.
The following signals are propagated by the parent process to its children.
.TP 10
SIGTERM
Close all connections and exit.
.TP
SIGHUP
Reread the configuration file.
New consoles are managed by forking off new children, deleted
consoles (and their clients) are dropped,
and changes to consoles are done "in place", resetting the console
port (bringing it down and up) only when necessary.
The console name is used to determine when consoles
have been added/removed/changed.
All actions performed by SIGUSR2 are also performed.
.TP
SIGUSR1
Try to connect to any consoles marked as down.
This can come in handy if you had a terminal server (or more)
that wasn't accepting connections at startup and you want
.B conserver
to try to reconnect to all those downed ports.
.TP
SIGUSR2
Close and reopen all console logfiles
and, if in daemon mode
.RB ( \-d
option), the error logfile (see the
.BR \-L
option).
All actions performed by SIGUSR1 are also performed.
.PP
Consoles which have no current client
connection might produce important error messages.
With the
.B \-u
option, these ``unloved'' errors are labeled with a machine name
and output on stdout (or, in daemon mode, to the logfile).
This allows a live operator or an automated log scanner
to find otherwise unseen errors by watching in a single location.
.PP
.B Conserver
must be run as root if it is to bind to a port under 1024 or if it
must read protected password files (like shadow passwords)
for authentication (see
.BR conserver.passwd (5)).
Otherwise, it may be run by any user, with
.B \-p
used to specify a port above 1024.
.PP
If encryption has been built into the code
.RB ( --with-openssl ),
encrypted client connections (without certificate exchanges) happen
by default.
To add certificate exchanges, use the
.B \-c
option with the client and server.
For authentication of the certificates to work,
the signing certificate must be properly trusted, which usually means
the public portion is in
.IB OPENSSL_ROOT /ssl/certs
(on both the client and server sides).
See the sample self-signing certificate making script
.B contrib/maketestcerts
for further clues.
To allow
non-encrypted client connections (in addition to encrypted client
connections), use the
.B \-E
option.
.SH OPTIONS
.PP
Options may be given as separate arguments (e.g.,
.B \-n
.BR \-d )
or clustered (e.g.,
.BR \-nd ).
Options and their arguments may be separated by optional white space.
Option arguments containing spaces or other characters special to the shell
must be quoted.
.TP 12
.B \-7
Strip the high bit off of all data received,
whether from the
.B console
client or from the console device, before any processing occurs.
.TP
.BI \-a type
Set the default access type for incoming connections from
.B console
clients:
.RB ` r '
for refused (the default),
.RB ` a '
for allowed, or
.RB ` t '
for trusted.
This applies to hosts for which no matching entry is found in
the access section of
.BR conserver.cf (5).
.TP
.BI \-b port
Set the base port for children to listen on.
Each child starts looking for free ports at
.I port
and working upward, trying a maximum number of ports
equal to twice the maximum number of groups.
If no free ports are available in that range,
.B conserver
exits.
By default,
.B conserver
lets the operating system choose a free port.
.TP
.BI \-c cred
Load an SSL certificate and key from the PEM encoded file
.IR cred .
.TP
.BI \-C config
Read configuration information from the file
.IR config .
The default
.I config
may be changed at compile time using the
.B --with-cffile
option.
.TP
.B \-d
Become a daemon.
Disconnects from the controlling terminal and sends
all output (including any debug output) to the logfile (see
.BR \-L ).
.TP
.B \-D
Enable debugging output, sent to stderr.
Multiple
.B \-D
options increases debug output.
.TP
.B \-E
If encryption has been built into the code
.RB ( --with-openssl ),
encrypted client connections are a requirement.
This option allows non-encrypted clients (as well as encrypted clients) to
connect to consoles.
.TP
.B \-F
Do not automatically reinitialize failed (unexpectedly closed) consoles.
If the console is a program (`|' syntax) and it closes with a zero
exit status, the console is reinitialized regardless of this option.
Without this option, a console is immediately reopened,
and if that fails, retried every minute until successful.
This option has no effect on the
.B \-o
and
.B \-O
options.
.TP
.B \-h
Output a brief help message.
.TP
.B \-i
Initiate console connections on demand (and close them when not used).
.TP
.BI \-L logfile
Log errors and informational messages to
.I logfile
after startup in daemon mode
.RB ( \-d ).
This option does not apply when not running in daemon mode.
The default
.I logfile
may be changed at compile time using the
.B --with-logfile
option.
.TP
.BI \-m max
Set the maximum consoles managed per process.
The default
.I max
may be changed at compile time using the
.B --with-maxmemb
option.
.TP
.BI \-M master
Normally, this allows conserver to bind to a
particular IP address (like `127.0.0.1') instead of all interfaces.
The default is to bind to all addresses.
However, if
.B --with-uds
was used to enable Unix domain sockets for client/server communication,
this points conserver to the directory where it should store the sockets.
The default
.I master
directory
.RB (`` /tmp/conserver '')
may be changed at compile time using the
.B --with-uds
option.
.TP
.B \-n
Obsolete (now a no-op); see
.BR \-u .
.TP
.B \-o
Normally, a client connecting to a ``downed'' console does just that.
Using this option, the server will automatically attempt to open
(``bring up'') the console when the client connects.
.TP
.BI \-O min
Enable periodic attempts (every
.I min
minutes) to open (``bring up'') all downed
consoles (similar to sending a SIGUSR1).
Without this option, or if
.I min
is zero, no periodic attempts occur.
.TP
.BI \-p port
Set the TCP port for the master process to listen on.
This may be either a port number or a service name.
The default
.IR port ,
``conserver'' (typically 782),
may be changed at compile time using the
.B --with-port
option.
If the
.B --with-uds
option was used, this option is ignored.
.TP
.BI \-P passwd
Read the table of authorized user data from the file
.IR passwd .
The default
.I passwd
may be changed at compile time using the
.B --with-pwdfile
option.
.TP
.B \-R
Disable automatic client redirection to other conserver hosts.
This
means informational commands like
.B \-w
and
.B \-i
will only show the status of the local conserver host and attempts to
connect to remote consoles will result in an informative message to the user.
.TP
.B \-S
Do not run the server, just perform a syntax check of configuration file and
exit with a non-zero value if there is an error.
Using more than one
.B \-S
will cause conserver to output various information about each console in 5
colon-separated fields, enclosed in curly-braces.
The philosophy behind the output is to provide information to allow external
detection of multiple consoles access the same physical port.
Since this is
.I highly
environment-specific, conserver cannot do the check internally.
.RS
.TP 9
.I name
The name of the console.
.TP
.I master
The hostname of the master conserver host for the console.
.TP
.I aliases
The console aliases in a comma-separated list.
.TP
.I type
The type of console.
Values will be a `/' for a local device, `|' for
a command, `!' for a remote port, `%' for a Unix domain socket,
and `#' for a noop console.
.TP
.I details
Multiple values are comma-separated and depend on the type of the console.
Local devices will have the values of the device file and baud rate/parity.
Commands will have string to invoke.
Remote ports will have the values of the remote hostname and port number.
Unix domain sockets will have the path to the socket.
Noop consoles will have nothing.
.RE
.TP
.B \-u
Send unloved console output to
.BR conserver 's
stdout (which, in daemon mode, is redirected to the logfile).
This applies to all consoles to which no user is attached,
independent of whether logging of individual consoles is enabled via
.B conserver.cf
entries.
.TP
.BI \-U logfile
Copy all console data to the ``unified''
.IR logfile .
The output is the same as the
.B \-u
output, but all consoles, not
just those without a user, are logged.
Each line of output is prefixed with the console name.
If a user is attached read/write, a `*' is appended to the console name,
to allow log watching utilites to ignore potential user-introduced alarms.
.TP
.B \-v
Echo the configuration as it is being read (be verbose).
.TP
.B \-V
Output the version number and settings of the
.B conserver
program and then exit.
.SH PROTOCOL
.PP
The protocol used to interact with the
.B conserver
daemon has two basic styles.
The first style is the initial line-based mode, which occurs before
connecting to a console.
The second style is the character-based, escape-sequence mode, while
connected to a console.
.PP
The initial line-based mode begins the same for both the master process
and its children.
Upon a successful (non-rejected) client connection, an ``ok'' is sent.
The client then issues a command and the server responds to it with a
result string (``ok'' being the sign of success for most commands).
The commands available are ``help'', ``ssl'' (if
SSL was built into the code), ``login'', and ``exit''.
Using the ``login'' command, the client authenticates and gains access to
the extended command set.
This is where the master process and its children differ.
The master process gives the client access to global commands, and the
child provides commands for interacting with the consoles it manages.
The ``help'' command, in both cases, will provide a complete
list of commands and a short description of what they do.
.PP
The second, character-based, style of interaction occurs when the client
issues the ``call'' command with a child process.
This command connects the client to a console and, at that point, relays
all traffic between the client and the console.
There is no more command-based interaction between the client and the server,
any interaction with the server is done with the default escape sequence.
.PP
This is, by no means, a complete description of the entire client/server
interaction.
It is, however, a brief explanation in order to give a idea of
what the program does.  See the
.B \s-1PROTOCOL\s0
file in the distribution for further details.
