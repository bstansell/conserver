Upgrading?

    Whenever you upgrade I suggest you upgrade both the client and
    server.  Most times, however, you can get away without upgrading
    the client (it's usually a fairly static piece of code).  I'll
    document any dependencies here, but check the CHANGES file for any
    new features added to the client if you're considering *not*
    upgrading.

    Version 8.1.3
	- The '^Ec;' sequence won't work correctly with 8.1.2 (where it
	  was introduced).

    Version 8.1.2
	- The 'devicesubst' and 'execsubst' formats have changed from
	  8.1.1.  It's fairly simple to update your config file to the
	  new format...just check the conserver.cf manpage.  Sorry for
	  having to change things, but it's for a good reason (I should
	  have though ahead when designing the original format).

    Version 8.1.0

	- The client/server protocol has changed to better protect 8-bit
	  data and to allow programs invoked with '^Ec|' not have to
	  worry about accidentally sending the escape sequence to the
	  server.  Though it will look like things are mostly
	  backward-compatible, don't count on it and just upgrade.

    Version 8.0.2

	- I've added a '^Ec;' sequence to allow the client to signal the
	  server as to when it's ready to see console data.  Without
	  this, verbose consoles will prevent clients from attaching
	  (the client sees unexpected data).  An 8.0.2 client should be
	  compatible with an 8.0.1 server, but an 8.0.1 client is not
	  compatible with an 8.0.2 server.

    Version 8.0.1

	- There's a slight client/server protocol change to implement
	  the new 'initcmd' console option.  If you use this
	  functionality with an 8.0.0 client, you'll run into a
	  compatibility problem while the 'initcmd' command is running.

    Version 8.0.0

	- The client/server protocol has been rearchitected.  You *MUST*
	  use an 8.0.0 client with an 8.0.0 server.  No combination of
	  client/server will work with pre-8.0.0 code.

	- Upgrading from pre-8.0.0 code to 8.0.0 and beyond requires
	  you to change your conserver.cf and conserver.passwd files
	  because both of the file formats have changed.

	  The conserver.cf file changes are so major that there is a
	  convert program available in the conserver subdirectory.  Just
	  run './conserver/convert <old-cf-file>' and it will attempt a
	  conversion to the new format, sending it to stdout.  Any errors
	  will be printed to stderr.  There are a couple of things
	  you might need to adjust.  First are the user access lists.
	  If you are restricting users to certain consoles in your old
	  conserver.passwd file, you'll need to move those restrictions
	  into the new conserver.cf file.  Restrictions are set with the
	  'ro' and 'rw' tags in the configuration file.  Second are the
	  'access' blocks.  What get produced by the convert program
	  will be functionally equivalent to the old behavior, but you
	  may be able to tune things to better suit your environment.

	  The conserver.passwd file's console restrictions have moved,
	  as described above.  So to convert the conserver.passwd file,
	  all you really need to do is something like:

		awk -F: '{print $1 ":" $2}' <old-passwd-file>

	  If you have comments or continuation lines in your file,
	  you'll have to do a bit more cleanup to strip out the third
	  field (which is what the awk command is intending to do).

	- Conserver no longer trusts reverse DNS information by default.
	  If you use the --with-trustrevdns configure flag, you can
	  re-enable the use of gethostbyaddr() [I don't recommended it,
	  however].  If you are using domain names in access lists,
	  you'll either need to change those to use hostnames and/or ip
	  addresses/ranges or use the --with-trustrevdns flag.  For
	  example, if you have (in the
	  8.0.0 format):

		allowed conserver.com;  # allow *.conserver.com

	  then you'll need to worry about this change.  If you only use
	  full hostnames, you shouldn't have to do anything.

    Version 7.2.4

        - If SSL support is compiled into the code, older versions of
          the client and server are, by default, incompatible because
          encrypted connections are a requirement.  Use of the -E flag in
          the client and/or server can work around this (but I discourage
          this - please upgrade the clients and servers instead).

    Version 7.2.0

        - The code related to broadcast messages in the client (-b) has
          changed.  If you want the username to come across properly in
          the broadcast message, you'll need to make sure you upgrade
          to the 7.2.0 client.

    Version 7.1.1

        - Both conserver.passwd and conserver.cf file parsing behaves
          the same now.  Both use leading whitespace as a continuation
          line indicator - if you have leading whitespace on a line
          (aside from comments) you probably should remove it.

    Version 7.1.0

        - The client/server protocol has changed.  You *MUST* use a
          7.1.0 client with a 7.1.0 and above server.  A 7.1.0 client
          is *not* backward compatible with a pre-7.1.0 server.

        - Some of the flags in the client (-d, -D, and -r) and server
          (-n) have been given new identities to make the client and
          server flags more uniform.

        - The conserver.passwd file now uses the first username match
          to determine access rights - if you have multiple instances
          of a username in an existing password file, they must be
          combined into one to continue to work.


Quickie Instructions

    - Download conserver (http://www.conserver.com/) and unpack

    - Run './configure'

    - Run 'make'

    - Run 'make test'

    - If all is well, run 'make install'

    - Now set up config files, etc. (see below)


Detailed Instructions

    - First thing to do is determine if you want different defaults.  A
      './configure --help' will show you the basics.  If you like all
      the defaults shown, you're set.  If not, here are the conserver
      unique options:

        --with-port=PORT        Specify port number [conserver]
        --with-base=PORT        Base port for secondary channel [0]
        --with-master=MASTER    Specify master server hostname [console]
        --with-cffile=CFFILE    Specify config filename
                                [SYSCONFDIR/conserver.cf]
        --with-pwdfile=PWDFILE  Specify password filename
                                [SYSCONFDIR/conserver.passwd]
        --with-logfile=LOGFILE  Specify log filename [/var/log/conserver]
        --with-pidfile=PIDFILE  Specify PID filepath [/var/run/conserver.pid]
        --with-maxmemb=MAXMEMB  Specify maximum consoles per process [16]
        --with-timeout=TIMEOUT  Specify connect() timeout in seconds [10]
        --with-trustrevdns      Trust reverse DNS information
        --with-extmsgs          Produce extended messages
        --with-uds[=DIR]        Use Unix domain sockets for client/server
                                communication [/tmp/conserver]
        --with-libwrap[=PATH]   Compile in libwrap (tcp_wrappers) support
        --with-openssl[=PATH]   Compile in OpenSSL support
        --with-dmalloc[=PATH]   Compile in dmalloc support
        --with-pam              Enable PAM support

      Not surprisingly, some match the old conserver/cons.h items...here
      they are for reference:

        PORT or SERVICE         - Socket used to communicate
        HOST                    - Hostname of console server
        CONFIG                  - Config file path
        PASSWD_FILE             - Password file path
        MAXMEMB                 - Number of consoles per child process

      A couple of notes.  First, --with-libwrap will add tcp_wrappers
      lookups to all socket connections in the server.  --with-openssl
      will add encryption between the client and server when you connect
      to a console.  --with-uds will cause the client and server to use
      unix domain sockets for their communication, eliminating the
      tcp communication they normally do (which means --with-master and
      --with-port are not used).  --with-dmalloc should only be used to
      do memory allocation debugging and not used in production.

    - Run './configure'.  This will detect system specific
      information.  The --prefix option will redirect where things are
      installed.  Other options are available as well...try
      './configure --help'.

    - Now run 'make'.  Hopefully things will compile.

    - To test your binaries, run 'make test'.  If there are problems, it
      should mean something is wrong, but check the output differences
      to make sure it wasn't a temporary failure.  I tried to make the
      tests generic, but I may have missed something.

    - Once things build, you can run 'make install'.

    - If you'd like to build the autologin application, you'll need to
      run 'make autologin'.  If you'd like it installed, use 'make
      autologin.install'.

    - Now that the binaries are in place, we need to set up the
      configuration files and such.

      + Does your conserver master hostname exist?  This is the
        hostname specified with the --with-master option.  By default
        the hostname is "console", so make sure it's in DNS, hosts
        files, or whatever.

      + If you used a symbolic name for the --with-port option (by
        default it uses "conserver", so the answer would be yes),
        you'll need to enter a definition in your services file
        (directly, via NIS, or whatever).  Here's what we use:

            console      782/tcp    conserver    # console server

        If you used a number, you shouldn't have to worry about this
        step.

      + Next, make sure conserver runs during boot.  The init script we
	use under Solaris is installed in
	<DATADIR>/examples/conserver/conserver.rc.  Use that or some
	form of it for your own /etc/init.d script or an entry in
	startup files (/etc/rc, /etc/rc.local, or whatever).

      + Now for the fun stuff.  You need to create a conserver.cf and
        conserver.passwd file.  Those are defined with the
        --with-cffile and --with-pwdfile settings.  If you ever need to
        know what values were compiled into conserver, run 'conserver
        -V'.  See the conserver.cf/INSTALL file for instructions on
        setup of these files.

    - That's it!  Just start up the console server and enjoy!


Other Information And Gotchas

    - Debian Linux Distribution

        The Debian folks have conserver distributed with the package
        names of conserver-client and conserver-server.  They are in
        the distribution "sid" and the "non-free" part (because the
        Ohio State license doesn't explicitly allow for modification to
        the code, even though it's totally implied and the intention of
        the author - I've even got proof in email!  Oh well, can't
        blame the Debian folks for being cautious - they've been burned
        before, apparently).

    - Potential GCC bug

        Adam Morris <AMorris@providence.org> reported a problem with
        the following line in console/console.c:

            if ((in_addr_t) (-1) == pPort->sin_addr.s_addr) {

        This tickles a GCC bug under HP-UX 11.11 using GCC 3.0.2 in
        64-bit mode with optimization enabled (-O).  The bug could
        possibly be provoked in other combinations as well.  His fix is
        to change the line to:

            if ((in_addr_t) (-1) == inet_addr(pcToHost)) {

        It's also reported that newer versions of the compiler fix the
        issue, so if you happen to have problems with the client
        connecting to servers, you might be tickling this bug and you
        can upgrade the compiler, turn off the optimization, or apply
        this code change.
