License Concerns
================

The licenses attached to this software ([LICENSES](LICENSES)) are supposed
to paint a simple concept: that this software was built for the open source
community and they result in a license compatible with [LICENSE](LICENSE).

Unfortunately, the real world steps in and troubles can arise.  This note
has been moved over from the [INSTALL](INSTALL) file:

    The Debian folks have conserver distributed with the package
    names of conserver-client and conserver-server.  They are in
    the distribution "sid" and the "non-free" part (because the
    Ohio State license doesn't explicitly allow for modification to
    the code, even though it's totally implied and the intention of
    the author - I've even got proof in email!  Oh well, can't
    blame the Debian folks for being cautious - they've been burned
    before, apparently).

Here's a copy of the message I exchanged with Thomas A. Fine (original
author at OSU) in 2001 that is referenced above:

Hopefully corporations (or, I suppose, their lawyers) will be happy with the
explanation above and become comfortable with the stated license.
