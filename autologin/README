This file used to say "I have not touched the autologin directory."
That's no longer true.  I've applied patches submitted by the user
community (see the CHANGES file for details).  I still cannot guarantee
anything, but it sounds like at least one person out there is
successfully using the code.  And now for my original hand-waving...

See the README.old and INSTALL.old files if you interested in the
program.  I cannot guarantee it will compile, install, or run.  It is
definately not integrated with ../Makefile or any of the porting
support.  If you have patches that make it work, please send them to me
and I'll be more than happy to incorporate them.

No one I've ever talked to found a need for something like autologin.
Good luck.
