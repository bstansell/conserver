          <P>From an email I once sent...</P>

          <P>Conserver is an application that allows multiple users
          to watch a serial console at the same time. It can log
          the data, allows users to take write-access of a console
          (one at a time), and has a variety of bells and whistles
          to accentuate that basic functionality. The idea is that
          conserver will log all your serial traffic so you can go
          back and review why something crashed, look at changes
          (if done on the console), or tie the console logs into a
          monitoring system (just watch the logfiles it creates).
          With multi-user capabilities you can work on equipment
          with others, mentor, train, etc. It also does all that
          client-server stuff so that, assuming you have a network
          connection, you can interact with any of the equipment
          from home or wherever.</P>

          <H3>The FAQ</H3>
          Here's the conserver <A href="FAQ">FAQ</A>. Got any
          additions? Let me know. 

          <H3>Mailing Lists</H3>

          <P>There are currently two mailing lists available. <A
          href=
          "mailto:announce@conserver.com">announce@conserver.com</A>
          is an announcement-only mailing list for informing of new
          versions, major developments, etc. <A href=
          "mailto:users@conserver.com">users@conserver.com</A> is
          for general Q&amp;A, discussions, ideas, etc. for
          conserver users. You can sign up by sending a message to
          <A href=
          "mailto:announce-request@conserver.com">announce-request@conserver.com</A>
          or <A href=
          "mailto:users-request@conserver.com">users-request@conserver.com</A>
          with a subject of "subscribe" or head over to the online
          <A href="https://www.conserver.com/mailman/listinfo">web
          pages</A>.</P>

          <H3>Origin</H3>

          <P>The console server software found here is a heavily
          modified version originally written by <A href=
          "http://hea-www.harvard.edu/~fine/">Tom Fine</A> (<A
          href=
          "mailto:fine@head-cfa.harvard.edu">fine@head-cfa.harvard.edu</A>)
          at <A href="http://www.ohio-state.edu/">Ohio State</A>
          and then Kevin S Braunsdorf (<A href=
          "mailto:ksb+conserver@sa.fedex.com">ksb+conserver@sa.fedex.com</A>)
          at <A href="http://www.purdue.edu/">Purdue
          University</A>. Patches from Robert Olson (<A href=
          "mailto:olson@mcs.anl.gov">olson@mcs.anl.gov</A>) at <A
          href="http://www.anl.gov/">Argonne National
          Laboratory</A> were then applied to get network console
          support.</P>

          <P>Arnold de Leon (<A href=
          "mailto:arnold@corp.webtv.net">arnold@corp.webtv.net</A>)
          then fixed various bugs and added enhancements while at
          <A href="http://www.synopsys.com/">Synopsys</A>. I then
          took the result, continued fixing things, and added
          features we found useful.</P>

          <P><A href="http://www.gnac.com/">GNAC</A> (Global
          Networking and Computing - currently <A href=
          "http://www.certaintysolutions.com/">Certainty
          Solutions</A>) has been supporting my coding efforts (in
          too many ways to list) since 1996.</P>

          <H3>The conserver.com Distribution</H3>

          <P>The result is a combination of many people's work.
          This version is being released in hopes that it will help
          others. There is no warranty or support implied by the
          distribution of the software.</P>

          <P>So, what the heck is up with all the different
          conserver versions? Well, the original authors are
          continuing to distribute their own threads of the
          software so you have three main threads (as far as I
          know). First, there's Tom Fine's thread at <A href=
          "http://hea-www.harvard.edu/~fine/Tech/console-server.html">
          http://hea-www.harvard.edu/~fine/Tech/console-server.html</A>.
          He isn't actively developing it, however, according to
          the website. Next, there's Kevin Braunsdorf's version at
          <A href=
          "ftp://ftp.physics.purdue.edu/pub/pundits/">ftp://ftp.physics.purdue.edu/pub/pundits/</A>.
          Kevin is semi-actively working on his thread. Doesn't
          look like any new versions have been out since August
          2000 (version 8.5), but maybe this info will be out of
          date by the time you read this. Lastly, the conserver.com
          version is based on Kevin's "5.21-Beta" distribution, but
          since <B>HEAVILY</B> modified and enhanced (more details
          in the "Origin" section above).</P>

          <P>If I were looking for a conserver package I would
          either use Kevin's latest distribution or the
          conserver.com distribution. Which one? Well, obviously
          I'm biased and believe the conserver.com distribution
          should be your choice, but Kevin's does have UPS (serial
          port line toggling bits) that the conserver.com version
          doesn't have. What does the conserver.com distribution
          have? Well, in reality, too many things to list. You'll
          have to look at the <A href="CHANGES">CHANGES</A> file
          and see the enhancements, bug fixes, and general
          development since the original. Don't let the version
          numbers fool you - you'll have to compare and contrast
          for yourself.</P>

          <H3>Downloading</H3>

          <P>The current version, released on Apr 9, 2003, is <A
          href="7.2.7.tar.gz">7.2.7.tar.gz</A>. You can get it via
          <A href=
          "ftp://ftp.conserver.com/conserver/7.2.7.tar.gz">FTP</A>
          or <A href="7.2.7.tar.gz">HTTP</A>. See the <A href=
          "CHANGES">CHANGES</A> file for information on the latest
          updates.</P>

          <P>As of version 6.1.7, the packaging and numbering
          scheme has changed. I used to package conserver as
          conserver-GNAC-v.vv. Since <A href=
          "http://www.gnac.com/">GNAC</A> (now <A href=
          "http://www.certaintysolutions.com/">Certainty
          Solutions</A>) has changed its name I've decided to drop
          the GNAC portion and use a three-digit version number
          (conserver-v.v.v). Why change the version numbering? I
          need to differentiate this thread of the code from the
          original authors' and I couldn't come up with a good
          replacement for the GNAC name - sad, but true.</P>

          <H3>Installation</H3>

          <P>Check the <A href="INSTALL">INSTALL</A> file for
          instructions.</P>

          <H3>Systems Tested</H3>

          <P>Here's a list of systems that I've been told can
          successfully compile conserver. If anyone has more to add
          to this list (or something on the list doesn't work any
          more), please let me know.</P>

          <P>Zonker Harris has fabulous documents regarding the

          devices. His <A href="consoles/">Greater Scroll of
          Console Knowledge</A> is a great place to start.</P>
